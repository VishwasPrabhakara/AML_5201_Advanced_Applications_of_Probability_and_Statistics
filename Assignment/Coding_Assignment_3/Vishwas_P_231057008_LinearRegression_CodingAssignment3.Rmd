# How worse is the disease progression in unhealthy people compared to the overweight ones?

# BMI level underweight as the p value is very high

#>The difference in coefficients of unhealthy people compared to the overweight ones indicates that disease progression is significantly worse in unhealthy people compared to overweight ones.
